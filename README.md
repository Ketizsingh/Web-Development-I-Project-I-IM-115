Project I
IM 115 Web Development I

Eduardo Reis

Subject
Basic HTML 5 Web Page with CSS - 20%

Outcomes
In this project, each student is required to demonstrate to the best extent of his/her skills, their expertise using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Background
In the last decade, the advances of the latest technologies in big data has impacted the analysis of a vast amount of companies throughout all the industries sectors. Collecting data is a challenging task, and it involves the cooperation from dozes of individuals, up to thousands of millions and beyond. It is very important to make collecting data a pleasant task, so that it encourage the completion of the subjects (users) and the participation of future ones.

Expectations
As a current student of the Confederation College, and a employ candidate for these companies, the job is to select one the areas in industry and develop the interface of a survey.

The team is only developing the interface. So, no authentication is required. However, the team is required to properly define the navigation among the pages.

Avoid as much as possible repeating code. Use Javascript and create function when possible. Properly named functions decrease the number of comments.

Well commented code is required. Specially for code that was copied and pasted. For these, I expect every step to be well commented.

No free-rides, every developer of a group is expected to develop and dedicate to the project, every one is equally responsible for delivering the entire project. Pick the team members wisely.

Specifications
A survey of 15 (fifteen) questions well elaborated.
Five (5) questions per student
The survey should be broken down in to a certain number of pages
Showing 15 (fifteen) questions at once is uncomfortable for most of the users
The number of pages should be adequate to the layout of each question
But it should not be inferior to three (3) pages

Other requirements
Use Github

Break down the development of this project in small steps (tasks)
The simplest is the step, the better
Don’t over fragment commits.
Do not commit single line changes, unless that specific task only required a single line of code.
Each develop should user his/her own github account
Private Repositories only
Send me an invitation, my user is ecoelhor
Put reference to any code that you are not the author

Do not use bootstrap or any bootstrap like library.

Submission
Deadline is Friday, March 27th, 11:59 PM.
Deduction of 5% of the evaluated mark per day of delay
The number of files are not directly specified, that will be for the team discretion. However, make the project developer friendly. It a file is getting to big, break it into two or more.
Same idea applies for Javascript functions.
On Blackboard
DO NOT submit the downloaded .zip downloaded from the github.com website
Clone the repository locally, zip the entire repository and upload this one.
Copy the link for the repository on the submission page as a comment.
Good Luck,

Eduardo.
